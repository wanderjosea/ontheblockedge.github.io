# WELCOME SECURITY ENTUSIAST

Welcome to this space dedicated to hacking and blockchain, I am Gekk, and my 2 great hobbies are Cybersecurity and Blockchain, one is my job today, and the second is my hobby, I invite you to join this community, where I will be sharing my learning in cybersecurity and try to link this knowledge to blockchain whenever possible.


## What is Block on Brink 

I created this community to share content with 2 objectives, one is to continue my apprenticeship in cybersecurity, explaining a content is the best way to master it, and I want this to be the place where I can share it for free with the community, and another is, to start a community of people who share my interests for cybersecurity and blockchain.
